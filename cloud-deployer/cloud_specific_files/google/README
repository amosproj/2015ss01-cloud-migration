For running you'll need:
The Development-server by Google. Module can be loaded at 'https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads#Google_App_Engine_SDK_for_Python'

Attetions: First-time users have to authentificate their development server from google [just follow the step for first-time deployment by the programm of google]

####


If you want to start the Server in the cloud or localy. 

Global:
There has nothing to be done, except the path in deploy_config.py

Locally:
Do following steps:
- In the google-development-console assign an IP4-address to the SQL-DB or you get it working with ip6
- in start-server replace [[IP]] with the upper ip (expl.: [[IP]] --> 121.213.123.1)
- replace other options with data from Admins/Team

This Folder should contain the Files needed for Deployment on the google-cloud and for local deployment
- app.yaml
- appengine_config.py
- config.py                         [has to be served by YOU]
- deploy_config.py                  [has to be served by YOU]
- brutto-netto-rechner.pem          [has to be served by YOU]
- google_requirements_glob.txt
- google_requirements_loc.txt

######################## deploy_config.py ######################################################

In deploy_config.py shall 2 variables be declared!

_DEV_SEV_ = 'path to Google_development_server, called dev_appserver.py' 
_DEV_DEP_ = 'path to Google_development_deploy, called appcfg.py' 

Module can be loaded at 'https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads#Google_App_Engine_SDK_for_Python'

For local-deployment a call for the dev-server will be printed out and written in a file called: "start-server" at the Folder local
ATTENTION: after start-server is created you have to replace each [[XXX]] with the right content!
           expl.: [[USER]] --> herbert ,if user is herbert

You can either call via
> $(cat start-server)
or just type it in yourself via other means.
